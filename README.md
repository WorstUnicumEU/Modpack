This is a collection of mods that I have been using for a while now. I have done a lot of tweaking and changes of the mods to fit me - clean and minimal. The modpack contains a lot of information in the most clean way possible. Hopefully other people will also like this, and I will update this for future patches. If you want to contact me outside the forums you can send a message to me on Twitter [(@WorstUnicumEU)](https://twitter.com/WorstUnicumEU). I very much appreciate any feedback and I try to answer your questions as fast as possible.
